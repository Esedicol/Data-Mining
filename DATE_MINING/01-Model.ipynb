He is not sure how long he was out for but the next thing he remembers he was in the ambulance going to the hospital. He reports problems since that time although it was hard to get a sense of the specific symptoms he is experiencing. He reports he tends to wake up in the middle of the night and feels like he is having a seizure and can't control his body. He will feel disoriented at times (not completely dissociative, but feels \"weird, out of my body.\" He also had headaches and feels lightheaded. He reports he has also been struggling with depression since the incident where he will have good days and down days. On the down days, he wants to sleep all day and not get out of bed.   \n",
