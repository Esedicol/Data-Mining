# Data Import, Wrangling and Exploration

Povided	 with	 two	 supplementary	 files:	 "BSCY4.csv"	 and	
"BSCY4.sql" where each	of	the	 files	contains	a	partition	 from	the	"Avocado	
Prices"	 dataset	 available	 on	 Kaggle .	 You	 can	 get	 the	 detailed	
description	 of	 the	 fields	 of	 the	 two	 partitions	 following	 the	 link	
provided	as	footnotes.	
<br>
By using the pandas module	of	Python	to	import	
contents	 of	 both	 of	 the	 files,	 I cleansed	 the	 data	 and	 merge	 it	 into	 a	
single	 data	 frame.	 Both data contains errors so I used	 the	 techniques	
presented	to	you	us	class	to	correct	those	errors.
