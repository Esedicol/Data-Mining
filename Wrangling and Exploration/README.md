# Data Import, Wrangling and Exploration

During	this	lab	you	will	gain	practical	knowledge	of	the	data	import,	
wrangling	 and	 exploration	 techniques	 that	 have	 been	 presented	
during	Lectures	1-4.	To	refresh	the	material,	please	consult	the	notes	
available	for	the	module	on	Moodle.
You	 are	 provided	 with	 two	 supplementary	 files:	 "BSCY4.csv"	 and	
"BSCY4.sql".	Each	of	the	 files	contains	a	partition	 from	the	"Avocado	
Prices"	 dataset	 available	 on	 Kaggle 1 .	 You	 can	 get	 the	 detailed	
description	 of	 the	 fields	 of	 the	 two	 partitions	 following	 the	 link	
provided	as	footnotes.	
In	this	lab,	you	will	need	to	use	pandas module	of	Python	to	import	
contents	 of	 both	 of	 the	 files,	 cleanse	 the	 data	 and	 merge	 it	 into	 a	
single	 data	 frame.	 Note	 that	 some	 of	 the	 formatting	 and	 otherwise	
errors	 have	 been	 introduced	 into	 the	 data.	 Use	 the	 techniques	
presented	to	you	in	class	to	correct	those	errors.	Upon	completion	of	
this	 lab	 you	 will	 need	 to	 submit	 python	 code	 that	 help	 identify	
problems	 in	 data	 from	 both	 files	 as	 well	 as	 the code	 that	 corrects	
errors.
