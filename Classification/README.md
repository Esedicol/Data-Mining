# Lab 3: Classification of Iris Flowers.

I will use SciKitLearn module	 of	 Python	 to	
import	contents	of iris	dataset.	Assume that	the	dataset	provided	by
SciKitlearn is	clean	and	free	of	errors.	Use	the	techniques	presented	
to	you	in	class	to	split	the	dataset into	multiple	subsets	(i.e.	train,	test,	
validation).	Build	at	least	 three	different	classifiers for	 the	problem.	
Choose	 the	best	model	amongst	 those,	report	on	its	expected	 future	
performance.


Step	1. Import	the	Iris Dataset from	SciKitLearn. <br>
Step	2. Split	 information	 from	 the	 dataset	 into Train, Test,
Validation	subset.<br>
Step	3. Ensure	the	subsets	are	 Independent	and	Representative	
of	the	original	dataset. <br>
Step	4. Build	the	first	classifier	for	the	problem. <br>
Step	5. Build	the	second	classifier	for	the	problem. <br>
Step	6. Build	the	third	and	final	classifier. <br>
Step	7. Select	the	best	out	of	the	three	classifiers.<br>
Step	8. Report	 on	 the	 future	 performance	 of	 the	 selected	
classifier.
